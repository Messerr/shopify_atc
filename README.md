## How To

- Clone or Download Repo
- Navigate to root of repo in Terminal
- `npm install`
- Then `gulp`
- Your browser should open to the app automatically
- Select a store from the dropdown and watch the magic happen


## Error?
- Try `npm rebuild` if your `gulp` command isn't working

## NOTE!
- Some stores will not add directly to cart due to Shopify requiring a unique checkout token to verify the checkout is legit.
